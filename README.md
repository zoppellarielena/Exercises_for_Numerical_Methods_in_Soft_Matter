# Exercises for Numerical Methods in Soft Matter
This repository contains the reports of the exercises for *Numerical Methods in Soft Matter* course provided by University of Padova during a.y. 2023-2024.
All the simulations data are generated in **C++ scripts**, not shared in this folder.

The covered topics are the following:
1. **Sampling**: generate samples using simple hit-and-miss method and inverse sampling.
2. **Sampling via transformation of coordinates**
3. **Importance sampling**
4. **Markov Chains**
5. **Simulation of a 2D Ising model by the Metropolis algorithm**
6. **Advanced simulations of a 2D Ising model**: Wolff algorithm and Multiple Markov Chains
7. **Continuous time Markov processes, Gillespie algorithm**
12. **Reweighting techniques**
